Hello! I am Jayachandra. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Hyderabad.
During my time there, I worked extensively on Compilers with the Compilers group at IIT Hyderabad, ranging from Program Analysis with LLVM to building MLIR pipelines. I also had the opportunity to research on the topic of "Scalability of Polyhedral Compilation" under the guidance of Prof. Ramakrishna Upadrasta.

I have done good coursework in the field of Compilers and Computer Architecture. Just to list, Compilers 1 & 2, Intro to Compiler Engineering, Adv. Compiler Engineering, Adv. Compiler Optimizations, Intro to Program Analysis and Optimizations, Computer Architecture and Adv. Computer Architecture. I have also done the general Computer Science coursework.

I am currently looking for full-time opportunities (even internships) in the field of Compiler Engineering, either with LLVM or MLIR. You can find my resume on the sidebar (click on the file icon).
