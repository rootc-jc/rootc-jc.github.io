A hectic day with lot of academic work. I enjoyed a lot though ( Some work on Polyhedral representation with isl and some MLIR work). 
Going ahead, the plan is to seperate my academic work from whatever I do for fun here.

## Today

- Read about Alexnet
- Started writing a blog, it might take a couple of weeks to finish.

## Plan for Tomorrow

- Dependence Analysis and Dependence Abstraction from Chapter 5 of Scheduling and Automatic Parallelization book.
