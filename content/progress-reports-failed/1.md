## Idea

Just for fun, I thought I would document everything I learn in a day, and put it on the internet.

## My interests

As of now, I'm interested in computer systems and currently exploring compilers.
I'm also vaguely interested in AI.

### Compilers

I've spent last 7 to 8 months going into depths of Compilers field. Currently I'm studying Polyhedral compilation.

### AI

I was never an AI guy ( I don't like the word Artificial Intelligence. Sounds so artificial). But we have to agree on the part that it's everywhere now. I've always seen this AI as a bunch of loops. Every optimization, I work on ( or learn about in compilers) feels like it exists for AI to run faster. So, I want to figure it out in detail.

## Things I did today:

- Looked up some history of Deep Learning.
	- The reason why AI exists today and everyone is talking about is because how cheap and fast computation got thanks to better architectures and compilation techniques.
- Spent some time on learning about perceptron.
- Spent some time on working with [isl](https://libisl.sourceforge.io/) (integer set library).
	-  isl is a library, which can be used for Polyhedral Analysis.

## Things to do:

- Plan things better.
- Keep consistency. ( I'm an undergraduate student with a lot coursework to do, so this is a difficult thing)
